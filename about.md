turnstyl was created by Luke Terry and Tyler Roman to solve a big problem on campus.

Buy-Sell groups on campus serve an important purpose: students need a place to buy and sell textbooks, furniture, clothes, tickets, and other goods to each other. Platforms like GroupMe or Instagram are used most often, but they come with significant downsides. Hundreds of students get scammed every academic year, and hundreds more never sell the item they wanted to simply because these platforms arenâ€™t built for commerce.

turnstyl exists to create an environment where scammers naturally fail, and students are able to effectively buy and sell items to other students.

Luke and Tyler are currently perfecting their creation and preparing to launch.
